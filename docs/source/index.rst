.. _`_infrastructure_level_1`:

Infrastructure Level 1
----------------------

.. image:: _static/Infrastructure.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

The application's infrastructure has been virtualized using Docker containers. This allows maintainers and developers to set up and operate the project independently of the host platform. Security aspects are addressed through Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Dockerfiles). This infrastructure also supports scalability: when a container reaches its limits, more resources can be allocated or a new container can be spawned. In addition, the system achieves higher fault tolerance. With Docker containers, multiple applications can reside in the same network and wait for user input.

Quality and/or Performance Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Fault tolerance:** Multiple containers of the application can be spawned to take over the load in case of a failure. The application remains online.
- **Scalability:** The application container can be duplicated and run within the same network. The containers operate independently.
- **Maintainability:** The application can be migrated in the background while it is still running. After the migration is complete, containers are restarted one by one â invisible to the user.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The **Application Container** communicates via a native database connection with the **Database Container** through the component **Database Connection**.
- The **Application Container** communicates over the internet with the external third-party API **VirusTotal API**.
- The **User's Computer** communicates with the **Application Container** via HTTP over the internet using a web browser.

Cross-cutting Concepts
======================

.. image:: _static/Crosscutting.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

.. _`__emphasis_concept_1_emphasis`:

Logging
-------

The application uses structured logging to capture runtime behavior and diagnostics. All layers (API, application, and infrastructure) log significant actions and errors. Serilog is used as the primary logging library, and log messages include contextual information (e.g., request IDs, user IDs, exceptions). Logs can be routed to the console, files, or external log aggregation systems (e.g., Seq or Grafana Loki) depending on the environment.

This improves traceability, debugging, and auditability

.. _`__emphasis_concept_2_emphasis`:

Error Handling
--------------

The application uses a centralized error-handling strategy. Business rule violations are represented using result types instead of exceptions.

Validation errors, unauthorized access, and external API failures are properly logged and surfaced with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 401, 500), ensuring both developer insight and user-friendly feedback.

.. _`__emphasis_concept_3_emphasis`:

ASP.NET Framework
-----------------

The backend is built using ASP.NET Core 9.0 and follows Clean Architecture principles. Minimal APIs are used to keep the HTTP interface lightweight, and dependency injection is leveraged throughout the application.

MediatR is integrated to decouple application logic, and configuration is handled using strongly typed settings. The framework supports HTTPS by default, integrates easily with Docker, and provides built-in support for middleware, authentication, and environment-specific setups.
